Use case of the Project:
This Instagram Data Analysis is beneficial to both the users as well as Instagram's parent company Meta.

For users, this project showcases the various trends in instagram data. It helps to analyse which independent variables corresponds to the highest popularity on instagram. The users can also predict the total impressions on their posts given the likes,shares, comments etc. This project will also help users choose the the popular hashtags and captions .

This dataset will also help Meta, as Meta will become aware of the features of Instagram people are or are not using and will try to improve those features

Upon analysing the data of this sample, hypothesis testing can be done and conclusions can be made for the entire population of Instagram.


Dataset Description
The dataset contains 119 rows and 11 main features namely 'Impressions', 'Caption', 'Saves', 'HashTags', 'Profile Visits', 'Likes' , 'Follows' ,etc. By now you must have understood the target feature or value to be predicted is the Likes column which has been referred to as 'reach' so far. When Do people get more likes on a social media platform like Instagram? When a User has more followers, then the post reaches out to more peoples and chances are more to get more likes. To identify a linear relationship in data and build a simple Machine Learning model.


Functioning of the code:
The main file is insta_main.py which links all the pages and includes the code for the navigation between pages. The home_page consists of code for the home page . The  visualise file is used for data visualisation. The view_data file is used for viewing and analysing the dataset. The prediction file is used to predict impressions with 3 popular machine learning models. 
The View Dataset file consists of a highly interactive display of the dataset with filters, viewing specific columns etc. 
The correlation graphs and distributions are highly interactive and the features can be selected .
The prediction model does not use hyper parameter tuning INTENTIONALLY so as to make a highly interactive web app in which users can experiment and have COMPLETE control of the machine learning model. 


Requirements : 
python 3.9
pip install the libraries in requirements.txt file
